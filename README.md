NSFWBlocker is a simple and lightweight tool written in Python to help you block access to dozens of NSFW (18+) websites. Whether you want to create a safer browsing environment for yourself or others, NSFWBlocker is here to assist you in keeping explicit content out of sight.

## ‚ùî How it Works:

It works by modifying the hosts file on Windows, effectively redirecting requests to known 18+ websites to a local IP address (127.0.0.1). This prevents the websites from loading, making them inaccessible in most web browsers.

## üìÉ Requirements:

- Windows (Tested on Windows 10 & 11)
- Administrator privileges to access and modify the hosts file.

## üîë Installation and Usage:

1. Download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/Priscord/NSFWBlocker/releases) page.
2. Extract the downloaded zip file to a location of your choice.
3. Run the `blocker.exe` executable with administrative privileges (if it's not by default) by right-clicking on it and selecting "Run as Administrator."
4. It will automatically update the hosts file, blocking access to the listed NSFW websites.

## ‚ûï Contributions:

If you encounter any issues, have ideas for improvement, or want to add more websites to the block list, feel free to submit a pull request or create an issue.
